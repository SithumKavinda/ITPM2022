# Car-Care Management System
This project is based on a car service center business in Sri Lanka called The Car Clinic.
Due to the increasing number of vehicles they have to repair, managing the inventory has been difficult to manage when done manually.
To make the business more efficient and more profitable, they wanted to automate all the business procedures.
After going through their business procedures, we sorted out 4 functions needed to include in the application to make it a success.
And these 4 functions cover the main business processes in the car service center.





# Functionalities
- Inventory Management [Kaveesha]
- Employee Management[Tharushi]
- Customer Management [Janith]
- Payment Management [Sithum]

# Attention
- Refer GIT tutorial before working on the project (https://youtu.be/8JJ101D3knE).
- Create a branch with your functionality name before you clone the project (Ex: Functionality name: `Payment` -> Branch name: `Payment`).
- **Do not** work on other branches or files which belongs to other members. It will occur `errors` and `conflicts` and they will cause lose of current workload.
- Add `Model classes` and `Controller classes` to allocated modules. (Ex: Functionality name:`Payment` -> Modules will be `itpm.carcare.payment.models` & `itpm.carcare.payment.controllers`). Modules will be already created.
- All `Views` and `CSS` files should follow above order as well. You can find them under `webapp`
